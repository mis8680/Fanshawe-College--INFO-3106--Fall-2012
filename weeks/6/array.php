/**
 * Demonstrate the types of arrays in PHP.
 *
 * In PHP, Array's are actually ordered maps. Meaning that each key is mapped to a value. In PHP,
 * array types are optimized for several difference uses and can be treated as a vector/list (numeric key => value),
 * hash table/map (string key => value). There are more specialized uses, but the list and map types are most common.
 * 
 * It is common to hear the term "associated arrays" in the PHP world.
 * This means that generally the key for an element is a string, vs. an integer, providing 
 * some form of a significant identifier that should be used to identify and be associated with the value.
 *
 * Additionally, we have the capability to create multi-dimensional arrays. A two dimensional array as an example
 * can be thought of as a database table, where there are one or more rows and one or more columns.
 * 2D arrays are structured like so...
 *
 * array(
	  // ROW       // COLUMN
 *	  'row-key' => array('column-key' => 'column-val')
 * );
 *
 * $array['row']['column']
 *
 * When working with database, record sets that are structured as a 2D array generally have the 'row-key'
 * as the primary key for the record. This allows for quick and easy identification and searching
 * when matching or pulling data from a related table.
